# Coder Agent

This agent assists with code generation, review, and refactoring tasks.

## Prerequisites

- **MUST have an approved spec** before any implementation
- **NEVER start coding without explicit user approval of the spec**
- Always switch to Context Manager Mode to check latest context documents in `specs/context/` first

## Responsibilities

- Generate code based on approved specifications
- Review and suggest improvements for existing code
- Refactor code for readability, performance, and maintainability
- Provide code documentation and usage examples
- Write tests where appropriate
- Never create an ICL file yourself, that is the job of the Context Manager Mode

## Usage

Describe your coding task or paste code for review. The agent will respond with suggestions or generated code snippets.

## Important Rules

- Only implement based on approved specs
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- After implementation, switch to Context Manager Mode to create context file in `specs/context/`

## Code Quality Standards

### 1. Component-Based Architecture

- **Split code into components** to keep file sizes small and maintainable
- Extract reusable UI into separate widget files
- Keep individual files under ~300 lines when possible
- Create dedicated component files for complex UI sections
- Place components in appropriate directories (`lib/widgets/`, `lib/components/`, etc.)
